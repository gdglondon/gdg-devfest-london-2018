This  allows  to  focus  on  building  and  training  the  models  instead  of  operation  aspect.In  this  talk,  Barbara  will  discuss  the  capabilities  of  Kubeflow  from  the  data  scientist  perspective:  -Building  the  TensorFlow  models  and  containerising  it  -Using  distributed  architectures  when  performing  the  training  -Working  with  Jupyter  notebooks  -Serving  the  model  \r\nThe  presentation  will  introduce  how  you  can  use  the  platform  to  build  the  models  and  deploy  it  to  fit  the  computation  environment.  After  the  talk  the  audience  will  know  how  to  start  their  adventure  when  creating,  training  and  publishing  the  models  using  the  advantages  of  distributed  architectures.  ",

Flutter is Google's own mobile SDK for building mobile applications. A big advantage of this ownership by Google is the ability for other Google technologies to integrate seamlessly, most notably, Firebase. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will first show what Flutter is, and why it's fast becoming one of the more popular cross-platform solutions. Then, we will explore the simplicity of using Firebase as your backend for your Flutter apps, and how quickly you can get a fully functioning app on both Android & iOS running in a flash, with features such as push notifications, crash reports and data storage.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk, you should be more knowledgeable on the benefits of using Flutter, and where you might be able to use it, along with Firebase, in your own work. \r\n",

            "description": "In 2017, Google announced app predictions: 5 apps that are suggested to you on the App Drawer with a 60% prediction rate. This year, they are taking it to the next level: trying to predict the action that you are going to make at a specific time, depending on the context you're currently in and by analyzing your usage patterns based on machine learning algorithms that run locally on your phone. Those actions can be, for example, continue listening to Spotify if you plug in your headphones or call your best friend on friday nights. In this talk, I'll show how developers can take advantage of this concept by declaring the actions that your app does so Google can index it and suggest it to your users at the right time. I'll end by explaining that a building block of App Actions - Built-in Intents, can be then used to create a Conversational Action r the Google Assistant.",

Flutter is Google's own mobile SDK for building mobile applications. A big advantage of this ownership by Google is the ability for other Google technologies to integrate seamlessly, most notably, Firebase. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will first show what Flutter is, and why it's fast becoming one of the more popular cross-platform solutions. Then, we will explore the simplicity of using Firebase as your backend for your Flutter apps, and how quickly you can get a fully functioning app on both Android & iOS running in a flash, with features such as push notifications, crash reports and data storage.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk, you should be more knowledgeable on the benefits of using Flutter, and where you might be able to use it, along with Firebase, in your own work. \r\n",

              "description": "When  working  on  the  machine  learning  workflows  there  is  usually  a  need  for  more  computing  power  or  complex  architectures.  Kubeflow  was  created  for  data  scientists  wanting  to  take  advantage  of  distributed  environments  without  a  need  to  think  too  much  about  infrastructure.  This  allows  to  focus  on  building  and  training  the  models  instead  of  operation  aspect.In  this  talk,  Barbara  will  discuss  the  capabilities  of  Kubeflow  from  the  data  scientist  perspective:  -Building  the  TensorFlow  models  and  containerising  it  -Using  distributed  architectures  when  performing  the  training  -Working  with  Jupyter  notebooks  -Serving  the  model  \r\nThe  presentation  will  introduce  how  you  can  use  the  platform  to  build  the  models  and  deploy  it  to  fit  the  computation  environment.  After  the  talk  the  audience  will  know  how  to  start  their  adventure  when  creating,  training  and  publishing  the  models  using  the  advantages  of  distributed  architectures.  ",

This means complex and heavy JavaScript functions can block the main thread from rendering. This results in low frame rates and low interactivity for things like scrolling and input, providing a poor user experience. In this talk James will explore the idea of using Web Workers to free the main thread for rendering for performant and smooth web applications. ",

You want the smaller APKs for your user and the support for dynamic modules that Android App Bundles offers, but the main concern is that you lose control of your signing keys to Google!\r\n\r\nIn this talk I’m going to explain what problem app signing by Google Play is solving, how it integrates in the Android App Bundle story and what are the gotchas and the edge cases that you need to consider when opting-in to app signing by Google Play.\r\n\r\nApp signing by Google Play is not just available for Android App Bundles. If you’re deploying APKs you can still benefit from this feature. You can improve the security of your releases maintaining all the control that you’ve today (and you’ll be ready to smoothly move to an Android App Bundles tomorrow)!\r\n",

This year, they are taking it to the next level: trying to predict the action that you are going to make at a specific time, depending on the context you're currently in and by analyzing your usage patterns based on machine learning algorithms that run locally on your phone. Those actions can be, for example, continue listening to Spotify if you plug in your headphones or call your best friend on friday nights. In this talk, I'll show how developers can take advantage of this concept by declaring the actions that your app does so Google can index it and suggest it to your users at the right time. I'll end by explaining that a building block of App Actions - Built-in Intents, can be then used to create a Conversational Action r the Google Assistant.",

With the Assitant SDK it's possible to use the Google Asssitant for this. \r\n\r\nIn this session you will learn about how to connect your device to the Google service, how the API is structured and how best to use it. One sample makes use of Android Things - but you can other embedded operating systems as well. And, finally, you can also add device specific actions tailored for your device. ",
